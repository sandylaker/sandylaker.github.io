My academic journey started in China, where I obtained a degree in Laboratory Medical 
Science from *Southern Medical University* in Guangzhou, China. However, my passion for 
engineering led me to pursue a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at *TU Darmstadt* in 
Germany. Intrigued by the intersection of technology and medicine, I then completed a 
M.Sc. in Biomedical Computing at *Technical University of Munich (TUM)*.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the [Statistical Learning and Data Science (SLDS)](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de) 
group at *LMU Munich*, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/). 
My research interests lie at the (i) explainability in deep learning and (ii) self-supervised 
learning as well as their applications in clinical medicine.
