Before I came to Germany, I studied Laboratory Medical Science at *Southern Medical University*, Guangzhou, China. 
Then, I switched my major to engineering and studied Electrical Engineering (B.Sc.) at *TU Darmstadt*. After that, 
I studied Biomedical Computing (M.Sc.) at *Technical University of Munich (TUM)*. 
In June 2022, I will start my Ph.D. program in the [SLDS](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de) at *LMU Munich*, 
and my supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/).
My research interests are **self-supervised learning**, **explainable AI** as well as their applications in 
medical domain.
