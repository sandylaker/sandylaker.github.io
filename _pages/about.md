My academic journey started in China, where I obtained a bachelor in Laboratory Medical 
Science from *Southern Medical University* in Guangzhou, China. However, my passion for 
engineering led me to pursue a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at *TU Darmstadt* in 
Germany. Intrigued by the intersection of technology and medicine, I then completed a 
M.Sc. in Biomedical Computing at *Technical University of Munich (TUM)*.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the [Statistical Learning and Data Science (SLDS)](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de) 
group at *LMU Munich*, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/). 
I am also a junior member of [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai).
In 2024, I was also a visiting researcher at the Deep Learning Lab of 
[Prof. Dr. Kenji Kawaguchi](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/kenji/) at 
the *National University of Singapore (NUS)*. 

My research interests lie in trustworthy deep learning, with a particular 
focus on **explainability** and **uncertainty quantification**.
