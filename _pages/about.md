Before I came to Germany, I studied Laboratory Medical Science at *Southern
Medical University*, Guangzhou, China. Then, I switched my major to engineering
and spent three years studying Electrical Engineering at *TU Darmstadt*. In 2019,
I moved to *Technical University of Munich (TUM)* and studied Biomedical Computing (M.Sc.).
Recently, I am graduated from TUM and will become a Ph.D. candidate
at *LMU Munich* soon. I will join the [SLDS group](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de), 
and my supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/).
My research interests include **self-supervised learning**, **explainable AI** as well as their applications in 
medical domain.
