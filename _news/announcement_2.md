I started to teach the course 
[Applied Deep Learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch](https://moodle.lmu.de/course/view.php?id=20917)
at LMU together with my colleagues. In this course, we provide students with various exploratory
projects and challenges to get a solid understanding of deep learning frameworks.
